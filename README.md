## Project Team Members and their roles
- <b>Square:</b> Sue Christensen
- <b>Triangle:</b> Dhileepan Raju
- <b>Circle:</b> Jessica Meyer
- <b>X:</b> Mary Uhlir

## Team Member Role Responsibilities
- <b>Square:</b> Responsible for Github repository amd branches
- <b>Triangle:</b> Responsible for mockup/machine learning model
- <b>Circle:</b> Responsible for mockup/database
- <b>X:</b> Responsible for which technologies/strategy for life of project

## Project Technology that will Used:
- GitHub
    - Main Branch
    - Individual Branches(4)
    - Readme
- Postgres
    - SQL
- Python
    - Jupiter notebook

## First Segment: Sketch It Out:
- <b>Topic:</b> Red vs White Wine
- <b>Reason for selected topic:</b> 
- <b>Description of source data:</b> 
    
- <b>Questions we hope to answer with the data:</b>
    - can a machine learning model accurately predict the color of the wine? 
    
## First Segment Requirements:
### 1.	Presentation (x)

    - Content Team members have drafted their project, including the following:
      - Selected Topic:
      - Reason for selected topic:
      - Description of source data:
      - Questions we hope to answer with the data:

    Note: The content does not yet need to be in the form of a presentation; text in the README.md works as well. 

### 2.	GitHub(Square) 
     - Main Branch
       - Includes a README.md
    - README.md 
      - README.md must include Description of the communication protocols
    - Individual Branches
      - At least one branch for each team member 
      - Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment

    Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless  otherwise noted.

### 3.	Machine Learning (Triangle) 
    - Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
      - Takes in data in from the provisional database 
      - Outputs label(s) for input data

### 4.	Database (Circle)
    - Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
      - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
      - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

### 5.	Dashboard
    - N/A
