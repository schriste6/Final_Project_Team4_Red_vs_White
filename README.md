## Project Team Members and their roles
- <b>Square:</b> Sue Christensen
- <b>Triangle:</b> Dhileepan Raju
- <b>Circle:</b> Jessica Meyer
- <b>X:</b> Mary Uhlir

## Team Member Role Responsibilities
- <b>Square:</b> Responsible for Github repository and branches
- <b>Triangle:</b> Responsible for mockup/machine learning model
- <b>Circle:</b> Responsible for mockup/database
- <b>X:</b> Responsible for which technologies/strategy for life of project
## Machine Learning Model: 
   - <b>Classification:</b> The classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning Technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classiffication, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups.

## Communication Protocols
   - For the duration of this project, Slack was the primary communication platform, with email and text message as secondary options, and Zoom technology supported twice weekly and adhoc meetings.    

## Project Technology Used:
- GitHub
    - Main Branch
    - Individual Branches (4)
    - Readme
- Postgres
    - SQL
- Python
    - Jupiter notebook
- Tableau
- WordPress
     - JavaScript
     - HTML

## First Segment: Sketch It Out:

- <b>Topic:</b> Red vs White Wine
- <b>Reason for selected topic:</b> This topic was one that all the members of the group had some familiarity with the subject and an interest in it as well.
- <b>Description of source data:</b> 
Two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
The red and white wines are from the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

    - <b>Data Sets</b>: 
      - winequality-red.csv
      - winequality-white.csv
    - <b>Data sets information</b>: 
       - winequality-red.csv has 1599 rows and 12 columns.  
       - winequality-white.csv has 4898 rows and 12 columns.
    - <b>Data set attributes</b>: 
       - 11 input attributes
       - 1 output attribute
    - <b>Wine Attributes</b>: 
         - fixed acidity
         - volatile acidity
         - citric acid
         -  residual sugar
         -  chlorides
         -  free sulfur dioxide
         -  total sulfur dioxide
         -  density
         -  pH
         -  sulphates
         -  alcohol
         -  quality

- <b>Question we hope to answer with the data:</b>
     - Can we predict the quality of each red and white wine sample, to determine if it is low, medium, or high quality?
